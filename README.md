# EndlessMathsQuestions
An app that will randomize exercises according to a topic

## First deployment
The first deployment is with only home page and the first page of questions - adding up to 10. The main issue is to solve the logic here, and it will be the answer to many other pages. So that is what I deployed now.

## How it works?
So you going to the page through the navbar and writing your answers in the input bar. You can submit the answers and it will tic you if you were right and give you an x if you made a mistake.

Enjoy!
